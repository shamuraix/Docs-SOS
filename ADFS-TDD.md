# Data Migration Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design for migrating storage and authentication from Open Enterprise Server to Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and a 2-node Failover File Server Cluster using the Storage Migration Service and Windows Admin Center. The solution includes Distributed File System (DFS), drive mapping via Group Policy, and claims-based access controls with exception groups for older security groups.

## Objectives
- Migrate storage from Open Enterprise Server to Microsoft AD.
- Implement a 2-node Failover File Server Cluster.
- Utilize Storage Migration Service and Windows Admin Center for migration.
- Configure DFS for namespace management.
- Implement drive mapping via Group Policy.
- Set up claims-based access controls.
- Create exception groups for older security groups.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Preparation
- **Inventory**: Document all existing storage locations, user accounts, and permissions.
- **Backup**: Ensure all data is backed up before starting the migration process.
- **Environment Setup**: Prepare the Microsoft AD environment and the 2-node Failover File Server Cluster.

### 2. Storage Migration
- **Storage Migration Service**: Use the Storage Migration Service to migrate data from Open Enterprise Server to the new file server cluster.
- **Windows Admin Center**: Utilize Windows Admin Center to manage the migration process and monitor progress.

### 3. Distributed File System (DFS)
- **Namespace Configuration**: Set up DFS namespaces to provide a unified directory structure.
- **Replication**: Configure DFS replication to ensure data consistency across the file server cluster.

### 4. Drive Mapping via Group Policy
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**: Create GPOs to map network drives for users based on their roles and departments.
- **Testing**: Test the drive mappings to ensure they are correctly applied to user sessions.

### 5. Claims-Based Access Controls
- **Claims Configuration**: Configure claims-based access controls in AD to manage permissions based on user attributes.
- **Exception Groups**: Create exception groups at the top level for older security groups that require manual administration.

### 6. Validation and Testing
- **Data Integrity**: Verify the integrity of the migrated data.
- **Access Controls**: Test access controls to ensure users have the correct permissions.
- **Failover Testing**: Perform failover testing to ensure the cluster operates correctly during node failures.

### 7. Documentation and Training
- **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation to reflect the new environment and procedures.
- **Training**: Provide training to IT staff on managing the new environment and using the tools involved.

## Conclusion
This design document provides a comprehensive plan for migrating storage and authentication from Open Enterprise Server to Microsoft AD and a 2-node Failover File Server Cluster. By following these steps, the migration can be performed efficiently while ensuring data integrity and security.
