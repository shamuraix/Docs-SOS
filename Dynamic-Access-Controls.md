# Ideal Layout and Configuration for a 2x Node Windows Server Core Failover File Server Cluster

This document outlines the recommended architecture, layout, and configuration for a 2x node Windows Server Core failover file server cluster deployed on Dell VxRail with a VMware vSAN cluster. The solution is managed via Windows Admin Center (WAC) and is designed to migrate from an RBAC model with legacy security groups to a modern setup using Dynamic Access Control (DAC) and File Server Resource Manager (FSRM). Two new exception groups are introduced: one for administrative exceptions and one for temporary users (e.g., contractors or work placement).

## 1. Overall Architecture and Configuration

### Physical and Virtual Infrastructure

- **Dell VxRail Hardware**:  
  Provides the converged infrastructure, offering compute, networking, and storage resources.
  
- **VMware vSAN Cluster**:  
  Aggregates local disks across the VxRail nodes to create a resilient, shared datastore.
  
- **Virtual Machines on vSAN**:  
  Two VMs running Windows Server Core are deployed and configured as nodes in a failover cluster.
  
- **Windows Server Core Failover File Server Cluster**:  
  Configured for high availability of file shares, including:
  - Cluster validation and witness configuration.
  - Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) hosted on the vSAN datastore.
  - File shares configured with Continuous Availability to ensure client transparency during failover.

### Management and Service Integration

- **Windows Admin Center (WAC)**:  
  Centralizes management of the cluster, providing a modern interface for:
  - Monitoring cluster health.
  - Managing cluster roles and failover configurations.
  - Integrating with Windows PowerShell for automation.

- **Dynamic Access Control (DAC)**:  
  Replaces static RBAC with security groups by enabling:
  - Claims-based authorization and centralized policy management.
  - File classification and auditing through Active Directory and Group Policy.

- **File Server Resource Manager (FSRM)**:  
  Provides additional control by enforcing quotas, file screening, and generating storage reports to complement DAC.

## 2. Architecture Diagram

Below is an example diagram illustrating the system layout and integration:

    C[**Windows Server Core VMs**]
    D[**Failover File Server Cluster (2 Nodes)**]
    E[**File Shares on CSVs**]
    F[**Windows Admin Center**]
    G[**Dynamic Access Control (DAC)**]
    H[**File Server Resource Manager (FSRM)**]

```

*Diagram Explanation*:
- **Dell VxRail Hardware** forms the foundation for the entire solution.
- The **vSAN Cluster** aggregates local storage across nodes for shared use.
- The two Windows Server Core VMs operate as nodes in a **Failover File Server Cluster** providing high availability.
- **Windows Admin Center** is used to manage the cluster centrally.
- **DAC** and **FSRM** integrate with the file server to enforce dynamic access control and resource management policies.

## 3. Process Flows for Migrating from Legacy Security Groups

### A. Preparation and Inventory

1. **Inventory Existing ACLs**  
   - Use PowerShell and WMI queries to extract current volume ACLs.
   - Identify all legacy security groups applied to file shares.

2. **Define New Exception Groups**  
   - Create two new Active Directory groups:
     - **Admin Exception Group**: For administrators without dynamic management rights.
     - **Temporary Exception Group**: For contractors or temporary personnel.

### B. Migration Process

1. **Policy Design and Testing**  
   - **Draft DAC Policies**:  
     Define rules using claims and central access policies that replicate existing access but reference the new exception groups.
   - **Test in a Staging Environment**:  
     Validate policies on a test share to ensure correct behavior.

2. **Update Volume ACLs**  
   - **Automate ACL Modification**:  
     Develop a PowerShell script to:
     - Remove legacy security groups from volume ACLs.
     - Apply the new exception groups based on user roles (admin vs. temporary).
   - **Apply via GPO/DAC**:  
     Roll out changes using Group Policy or via a central DAC policy update.

3. **Validation and Audit**  
   - **Monitor Access**:  
     Use FSRM and event logs to audit file access and verify that DAC policies are enforced.
   - **Feedback Loop**:  
     Adjust policies as needed based on audit results.

### C. Process Flow Diagram

Below is a simplified flowchart illustrating the migration steps:

    C[Draft and Test DAC Policies in Staging]
    D[Develop PowerShell Scripts for ACL Updates]
    E[Remove Legacy Groups from ACLs]
    F[Apply New Exception Groups to ACLs]
    G[Deploy Policies via GPO/Direct Update]
    H[Monitor and Audit with FSRM & Logs]
    I[Finalize Migration & Document Changes]

    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    G --> H
    H --> I
```

*Flow Explanation*:
- **Start** with a comprehensive inventory of current ACLs and legacy groups.
- **Define** the new AD exception groups.
- **Draft** DAC policies and test them in a staging environment.
- **Develop** PowerShell scripts to automate ACL modifications.
- **Remove** legacy security groups and **apply** new exception groups.
- **Deploy** the updated policies via GPO or direct updates.
- **Monitor** the process using FSRM and event logs, then **finalize** and document the migration.

## 4. Best Practices and Considerations

- **Redundancy and Failover Testing**:  
  Regularly test failover scenarios to ensure business continuity.
  
- **Policy Review**:  
  Periodically review DAC and FSRM policies to adapt to evolving business needs.
  
- **Automation and Scripting**:  
  Leverage PowerShell and WACâ€™s automation capabilities to minimize manual errors.
  
- **Audit and Compliance**:  
  Use FSRM reports to track file usage and access, ensuring consistent enforcement of policies.

This comprehensive layout and migration plan modernizes your file server environment by transitioning from a static RBAC model to a dynamic, policy-driven access control system. The integration of Dell VxRail, VMware vSAN, Windows Admin Center, DAC, and FSRM ensures high availability, robust management, and compliance with evolving security requirements.
